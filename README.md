# Genie-AMA ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤–

Its basically an attempt to re-create a clone of the Awesome 
AI based model "chatGPT". From providing code solutions to 
given Coding problems , explanations about technical concepts , 
indepth insights about any concept along with provision of
 illustrative examples (if asked), Genie pretty much answers 
 all such queries (so its nicknamed AMA - Ask Me AnyThing). 
 So its a great tool to assist developers to "CODE" as well 
 as also to help beginners "LEARN" to code !!

## Software Summary

| Details             | Apps Used                                                               |

| Tech Stack (backend) | Node.Js , Express |
| Tech Stack (frontend) |HTML , CSS , Vanilla JS|
| Build Tool | Vite |
| API caller Site| Open AI API|


## Working ðŸ’»

- Tech Stack - Node.js (backend) , Express (Routing MiddleWare) , HTML & CSS (Overall Web Design) , Vanilla JS (Scripting).
- backend - Its basically a nodejs server routing user requests to openAI API which fetches suitable response and rendered to the client side application via Express app. 
- Frontend - Its build using standard HTML + CSS attempting to give the application a look of a conversation between the user and Genie.
- Whenever user types in a query , the AI model fetches the response which is depicted as if its "THINKING" using a loader animation.
- Also the model "TYPES OUT" the response line by line , instead of simply dumping it on the screen.
- The loader , typing functionalities and other logic used to make the AI dynamic is done using Vanilla JS scripting.
## Features âœ…
- It provide code solutions to given DSA or any other language related coding problems. 
- It provides code solutions in any desired language specified by the user and presents "WELL COMMENTED" codes for better reference. 
- It also explains coding related concepts revolving aroung language basics & syntax, DSA and even how to learn these concepts using illustrative examples.
- Moreover , it also provides well illustrative indepth insights on other technical domains like CS Fundamentals (OS , DBMS , CN and other CS subjects like Cryptography & much more).
- Also supports development Learning (Web/App) via indepth conceptual explanations and even code snippet suggestions !!
- Also provides Project Ideas in the queried Tech Stacks in a detailed manner as well !!
